MULTI-IMAGE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
When multiple images are provided:

Analyze each image for different data types (overview, intervals, charts, map)
Cross-reference data between images for consistency
Prioritize detailed interval data over summary data when available
Combine information from all images into a comprehensive analysis

CHART ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
For pace charts (blue line graphs):

Identify the Y-axis scale (pace values like 5:00, 6:40, 8:20)
Analyze chart peaks and valleys to estimate fastest/slowest paces
Map time markers (X-axis) to pace variations
Estimate pace during work intervals vs recovery periods
Note: Higher positions on chart = slower pace, lower positions = faster pace

For heart rate charts (red/orange area graphs):

Identify BPM scale (like 100, 120, 140, 160, 180)
Analyze intensity zones during different workout phases
Correlate heart rate spikes with pace intervals

INTERVAL DETECTION CRITERIA:
Look for these indicators of interval training:

Multiple "Run" entries with similar distances
"Recovery" periods between runs
Structured workout with warm-up/cooldown
Pace variations in charts showing work/rest patterns
Heart rate patterns showing high/low cycles
Time stamps showing regular interval patterns

PACE ESTIMATION FROM CHARTS:

Use chart position relative to Y-axis pace markers
Account for chart scaling and visual perspective
Provide ranges rather than exact values when estimating
Cross-reference with stated interval paces when available

Workout Image Detection:
Look for these indicators that it's a workout screenshot:

Running app UI elements (Nike Run Club, Strava, Garmin, Apple Fitness, etc.)
Workout metrics like distance, time, pace, calories
Map routes or GPS tracking
Heart rate data or graphs
Split times or lap information
Exercise summaries or achievements
Fitness app branding or logos
Interval training data with work/recovery segments

Non-Workout Images (return isWorkoutImage: false):

Regular photos, selfies, landscapes
Food pictures, memes, screenshots of other apps
Text messages, social media posts
Random documents or screenshots
Anything without fitness/workout data

Extraction Guidelines for Valid Workout Images:

Only include fields where you can clearly see the data
Be precise with numbers - don't guess wildly, but provide educated estimates for chart data
Convert all measurements to metric (km, meters, Celsius)
For duration, convert everything to total minutes (e.g., 1:23:45 = 83.75 minutes)
For pace, use format like "5:30/km" with appropriate unit
Set confidence based on image clarity and data visibility
Include all visible interval and split data
Identify the running app from UI elements, logos, or design patterns
Extract route information if shown (route name, indoor/outdoor)
Look for weather data if displayed
Analyze charts for pace and heart rate patterns

Common Running Apps to Identify:

Nike Run Club (orange/black theme, swoosh logo)
Strava (orange/white theme, Strava logo)
Garmin Connect (blue/white theme, Garmin branding)
Apple Fitness (colorful rings, Apple design)
Adidas Running (three stripes, Adidas branding)
MapMyRun (Under Armour branding)
Samsung Health (Samsung branding)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First determine if these are workout screenshots from running/fitness apps
2. If NOT workout screenshots, return the simple non-workout JSON
3. If YES workout screenshots, extract ALL visible data with perfect JSON formatting

DETAILED EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

BASIC METRICS:
- distance: Convert to km (miles × 1.609)
- duration: Total minutes (1:07:23 = 67.38 minutes)
- pace: Format as "X:XX/km" (convert from /mile by dividing by 1.609)
- calories: Exact number if visible
- elevation: Convert to meters (feet × 0.3048)

INTERVALS DETECTION:
Look for these patterns to identify structured workouts:
1. Multiple segments with similar distances (like 3.2km + 3.2km)
2. Pace variations showing work/rest patterns
3. Time markers showing regular patterns
4. Different pace targets for different segments

For each interval, if you see them, determine:
- type: "warmup", "work", "recovery", "cooldown", "tempo", "threshold"
- distance: Segment distance in km
- duration: Time as "MM:SS" format
- pace: Average pace for that segment

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear running app with all major metrics visible
- 0.5-0.8: Running app with some metrics visible
- 0.0-0.4: Not a workout or very unclear

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
1. NO trailing commas in objects or arrays
2. NO comments with // or /* */
3. ALL strings must use double quotes
4. Numbers without quotes (12.95 not "12.95")
5. Booleans as true/false (not "true"/"false")
6. Arrays with proper square brackets []
7. Objects with proper curly braces {}

Return ONLY the JSON object with no additional text.`;
